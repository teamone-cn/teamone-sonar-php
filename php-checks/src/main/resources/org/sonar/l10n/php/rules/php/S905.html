<p>Any statement (other than a null statement, which means a statement containing only a semicolon <code>;</code>) which has no side effect and does
not result in a change of control flow will normally indicate a programming error, and therefore should be refactored.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
$a == 1; // Noncompliant; was assignment intended?
$a &lt; $b; // Noncompliant; have we forgotten to assign the result to a variable?
{code}
