<p>Passing a reference to a function parameter means that any modifications the method makes to the parameter will be made to the original value as

particularly if the callee is not expecting a reference, and the improper use of references in function calls can make code less efficient rather than
more efficient. </p>

  As of PHP 5.3.0, you will get a warning saying that "call-time pass-by-reference" is deprecated... And as of PHP 5.4.0, call-time pass-by-reference
  was removed, so using it will raise a fatal error.
