<p>At root, <code>require</code>, <code>require_once</code>, <code>include</code>, and <code>include_once</code> all perform the same task of
including one file in another. However, the way they perform that task differs, and they should not be used interchangeably.</p>
<p><code>require</code> includes a file but generates a fatal error if an error occurs in the process.</p>
<p><code>include</code> also includes a file, but generates only a warning if an error occurs.</p>
<p>Predictably, the difference between <code>require</code> and <code>require_once</code> is the same as the difference between <code>include</code>
and <code>include_once</code> - the "_once" versions ensure that the specified file is only included once. </p>
<p>Because including the same file multiple times could have unpredictable results, the "once" versions are preferred.</p>
<p>Because <code>include_once</code> generates only warnings, it should be used only when the file is being included conditionally, i.e. when all
possible error conditions have been checked beforehand.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
include 'code.php';  //Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage and not conditional
include $user.'_history.php'; // Noncompliant
require 'more_code.php';  // Noncompliant; not a "_once" usage
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
require_once 'code.php';
if (is_member($user)) {
  include_once $user.'_history.php';
}
require_once 'more_code.php';
</pre>
