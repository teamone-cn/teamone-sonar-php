<p>According to the PSR2 coding standard:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The closing <code>?&gt;</code> tag should be omitted from files containing only PHP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the PHP manual:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>in some cases omitting it is helpful when using include or require, so unwanted whitespace will not occur at the end of files, and you will still
  be able to add headers to the response later. It is also handy if you use output buffering, and would not like to see added unwanted whitespace at
  the end of the parts generated by the included files.</p>
