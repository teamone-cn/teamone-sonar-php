<p>Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>
<ul>
  <li> It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten. </li>
  <li> There was a typo which lead the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
function doSomething() {
  ;                                              // Noncompliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}

function doSomethingElse($p) {
  echo $p;;                                      // Noncompliant - double ;
}

for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 10; doSomething($i), $i++);   // Noncompliant - Rarely, they are used on purpose as the body of a loop. It is a bad practice to have side-effects outside of the loop body
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
function doSomething() {}

function doSomethingElse($p) {
  echo $p;

  for ($i = 1; $i &lt;= 10; $i++) {
    doSomething($i);
  }
}
</pre>
