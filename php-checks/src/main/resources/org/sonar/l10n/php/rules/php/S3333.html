<p>The <code>open_basedir</code> configuration in <em>php.ini</em> limits the files the script can access using, for example, <code>include</code> and
<code>fopen()</code>. Leave it out, and there is no default limit, meaning that any file can be accessed. Include it, and PHP will refuse to access
files outside the allowed path.</p>
<p><code>open_basedir</code> should be configured with a directory, which will then be accessible recursively. However, the use of <code>.</code>
(current directory) as an <code>open_basedir</code> value should be avoided since it's resolved dynamically during script execution, so a
<code>chdir('/')</code> command could lay the whole server open to the script.</p>
<p>This is not a fool-proof configuration; it can be reset or overridden at the script level. But its use should be seen as a minimum due diligence
step. This rule raises an issue when <code>open_basedir</code> is not present in <em>php.ini</em>, and when <code>open_basedir</code> contains root,
or the current directory (<code>.</code>) symbol.</p>
<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
; php.ini try 1
; open_basedir="${USER}/scripts/data"  Noncompliant; commented out

; php.ini try 2
open_basedir="/:${USER}/scripts/data"  ; Noncompliant; root directory in the list
</pre>
<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
; php.ini try 1
open_basedir="${USER}/scripts/data"
</pre>
